============================================================
Generated on: 2025-09-15 09:21:45

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This Monte Carlo simulation analyzed construction pricing data to assess
risk and uncertainty in project cost estimates. The analysis included
multiple scenarios with varying material and labor cost assumptions.

KEY FINDINGS
---------------
• Baseline Total Estimate: $56,921.33 (mean)
• Standard Deviation: $17,672.22
• 95% Confidence Interval: $45,244.95 - $68,789.16
• Value at Risk (95%): $27,539.76
• Probability of Loss: 49.5%

  • Change from Baseline: -0.2%
  • Standard Deviation: $17,579.06

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
1. Risk Management: Consider hedging strategies for material cost volatility
2. Contingency Planning: Maintain 15-20% contingency for cost overruns
3. Scenario Planning: Regularly update cost assumptions based on market conditions
4. Monitoring: Track actual costs against simulated ranges for model validation
